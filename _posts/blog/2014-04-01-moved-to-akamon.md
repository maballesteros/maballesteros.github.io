Today it's an important day for me... I started working for Akamon Entertainment, as a backend engineer. They need a senior Java to stabilize their current game server *Akmuse*.

It's great to recover my developer profile, and also work in a thrilling environment as the game industry can be.

Working with my brother [Carlos](http://cballesterosvelasco.es/es) is a plus, also.
