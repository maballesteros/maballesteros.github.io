I created OQL (and it's successor JEC) to achieve *bidirectional data binding* in the [WAM presentation framework](/blog/2001/12/01/wam/).

Let's say you have the following expression:

```
book.pages[selectedPage].text
```

So, you have a *context* `Map` with a key/value pair `("book" -> Book)` pointing to a *business object* `Book` that holds a list of `pages`, that's an object with a `text` attribute. Another context key/value pair relates the `selectedPage` to an integer number: `("selectedPage" -> Int)`.

In the view rendering phase (it was done at the server side, the usual approach at that time), that expression was evaluated (we did a `get`) and the text of the selected book page was printed.

In the control phase, we received model updates and did a `set` of that expression.

That's all :-)

The 2nd version JEC was released to the Open Source community in SourceForge [jec.sourceforge.net](http://jec.sourceforge.net/). Here's an annotated class diagram of the JEC project:
