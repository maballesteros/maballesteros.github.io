2022 ended with the public release of Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL·E 2, and—most dramatically—ChatGPT. Within weeks it was clear that generative AI would spill into every domain. By early 2023 we were already prototyping **Koanly**, pivoting our education startup from a local exam-prep platform into a global AI-first product in barely three months.

Living that acceleration from the inside makes one conclusion unavoidable: the pace is overwhelming, even for those of us working at the frontier. Capabilities that were unthinkable yesterday become weekend hacks today.

## Beyond alignment: a crisis of purpose

The industry rightly worries about **AI alignment**—making sure advanced systems act in humanity’s best interest. Yet there is a second crisis brewing in parallel: **what happens to human purpose when AI can outperform us at the very skills that defined our identities?**

Imagine waking up to discover that the abilities that once made you unique are now replicable—and often superior—when executed by machines. Artists already feel it as image models learn their signature styles. Elite programmers watch GitHub Copilot draft 80 % of their code. Similar stories will play out across every profession.

Basic income and abundance might cover material needs, but they do not answer the question *“What do I do with my life now?”* Purpose is not a luxury; it is the organising principle of our days.

## Why I stay involved

Friends ask whether I’m okay; whether contributing to this transformation makes me complicit. I believe the opposite: participating gives me a chance to understand, influence, and—hopefully—shape the outcomes. Spectating from the sidelines would leave me without agency.

While we reimagine education through Koanly, I’m also committing to a longer-term project: exploring how we help humans reconstruct meaning in a world where AI handles the bulk of productive work.

## An open call

If alignment keeps AI on track, **purpose** keeps people anchored. Designing systems, rituals, and communities that offer meaningful challenges will be one of the most important undertakings of the next decade. I intend to work on it calmly, patiently, and with the curiosity that has fuelled every stage of my career.

What about you—have you started thinking about how we solve this?
