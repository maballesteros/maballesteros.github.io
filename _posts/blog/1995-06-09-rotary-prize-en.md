In June 1995 I received the **Rotary Valencia physics prize** together with my classmate [Francisco Camarena Femenía](http://personales.upv.es/~fracafe/web_Paco_Camarena/Bio.html). We were two twenty‑year‑old physics students armed with curiosity, a lot of late nights in the lab, and a project that tried to make wave phenomena easier to visualise for high‑school students.

The award was 125,000 pesetas—about 750 € at the time—which felt like a fortune. More important than the money was the feeling that rigorous work could actually resonate outside the classroom. It was the first public validation of a path that would later take me into research and, eventually, software.

I recently digitalised the original write‑up. You can browse the Spanish PDF [here](/blog/1995-06-01-premio-rotary/XXV_PREMIO_RCVC-99-104.pdf). It is a charming snapshot of mid‑90s scientific outreach, complete with diagrams painstakingly drawn in CorelDRAW and equations typed in WordPerfect.

What I keep from that experience is the sense of possibility. Recognition opens doors, sure, but mostly it tells you that the ideas inside your notebook might be worth sharing.
