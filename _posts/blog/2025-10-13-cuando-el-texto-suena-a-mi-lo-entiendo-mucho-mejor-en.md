While rewriting my [epigenetics article](/en/blog/cellular-youth/) I noticed something striking: the AI-generated version that mimicked my usual tone felt *dramatically* clearer than the original papers. Same facts, same graphs, but the sequence, connectors, and metaphors sounded like my brain.

**Hypothesis:** if you adapt the **style** of a text to the **style of the reader**, comprehension improves—not because of the generation effect (“I wrote it, therefore I recall it”), but because the message fits existing cognitive patterns.

## Why it works

- **Schema congruence** – New information integrates faster when it aligns with prior structures (classic schema theory).
- **Processing fluency** – Material that matches your rhythm, sentence length, and favourite connectors feels easier to parse, which boosts the *sense* of understanding (without guaranteeing learning).
- **Self-reference effect** – Content that addresses “me” slips into long-term memory more easily.
- **Linguistic alignment** – Conversational partners naturally converge on vocabulary and syntax; mirroring that alignment in a solo context tricks the brain into believing it is engaged in dialogue.
- **Conversational style benefit** – Instructional design research shows that personal, informal tone outperforms impersonal text.

## Guardrails

Fluency isn’t mastery. Easy-to-read text can produce the **illusion of competence**. To counter that, I pair personalised rewrites with retrieval practice: flashcards, summaries from memory, teaching someone else.

## Workflow I use

1. Feed source text + samples of my writing into an LLM.
2. Ask it to rewrite the material in “Miguel’s voice,” keeping technical accuracy.
3. Highlight uncertainties; request clarifications in the next iteration.
4. Generate short quizzes to confirm understanding.

The result feels like having a teacher fluent in my internal dialect. It’s not about narcissism; it’s about lowering the friction between new ideas and the mental slots waiting to hold them.
