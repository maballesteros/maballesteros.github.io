It happened to me with the [epigenetics article](/en/blog/cellular-youth/): the papers were impeccable, yes, but the **rewritten version in “my voice”** (generated by AI from my texts) was *infinitely* clearer to me. My turns of phrase, my order, my connectors. Suddenly, everything clicked.

**Simple hypothesis:** if you adapt the **style** of the material to the **style of the reader**, comprehension increases. Not because “I generated it” (there is no *generation effect* here), but because the text **fits** my **schemas**, **sounds** like my head, and **aligns** with how I process language. That has a basis.

## Why it (yes) works

*   **Schema Congruence.** We understand better when the new fits into previous structures (*schema theory*: Rumelhart). A text that respects *my* typical way of organizing ideas reduces the integration effort. ([academypublication.com][1])
*   **Processing Fluency.** What is processed more fluently is judged to be clearer and “truer”. If the text uses my patterns (sentence length, connectors, rhythm), fluency increases and **the feeling of comprehension** as well. Note: feeling ≠ learning (I'll come back to this). ([SAGE Journals][2])
*   **Self-Reference.** When the content “speaks to me” in my own register, it touches the *self* and is encoded better (self-reference effect). ([PubMed][3])
*   **Linguistic Alignment.** In real dialogue, we tend to synchronize representations at multiple levels; this **alignment** facilitates understanding. A text “in my voice” simulates part of that effect. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][4])
*   **Discourse Personalization.** Research in multimedia shows that a **conversational/personal style** improves learning compared to an impersonal/formal one. Adapting voice and tone is not cosmetic: it is instructional. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][5])

> In short: I'm not talking about “generating to remember more”, I'm talking about **congruence**: when the form of the text **resonates** with my schemas and my style, I **understand better** now… and I *can* remember better later if I combine it with the right practice.

## “Okay, what if I apply it with my high school nephew?”

A quick, concrete, and measurable proposal:

1.  **Style Capture.** Gather 1,000–2,000 of his words (letters, stories, papers). Extract signals: average sentence length, frequent connectors (“so”, “in short”), level of technicality, typical examples.
2.  **AI Transformation.** Feed the syllabus (Economics / G&H) and ask the AI for **two versions**:

    *   **Official** (style untouched).
    *   **“Nephew” version** (same information, his voice).
3.  **A/B Test with Delay.**

    *   Study one unit with each version.
    *   **48–72 hours later**, free and applied recall test (2–3 problems). The metric is *better retention and transfer* in the “Nephew” version. ([PubMed][6])
4.  **Iterate.** Adjust connectors, examples, and metaphors that worked best; repeat in another unit.

## Risk and Antidote: The “Illusion of Fluency”

A known danger: when something **flows** too much, I **believe** I know it better than I actually do (*illusions of competence*). Solution: combine the personalized text with **retrieval practice** (spaced mini-tests, explaining aloud, etc.). **Testing > rereading.** ([PubMed][7])

## Closing

My discovery is not “write it yourself and you will learn more”, but **have it explained to you in your own voice**. That layer of transformation —including AI— **reduces friction**, **aligns schemas**, and **brings the concept closer**. Then, you finish it off with spaced retrieval to consolidate. Immediate clarity + long-term memory. ([academypublication.com][1])
