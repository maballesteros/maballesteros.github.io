This post translates the opening chapter of a three-part series I published in 1999 about **autonomous mobile agents** and IBM Japan’s **Aglets** SDK. At the time it sounded equal parts futuristic and alarming—self-propelled code hopping across the network?—yet the concept laid the groundwork for many distributed systems ideas that resurfaced later in serverless computing and edge orchestration.

## What is a mobile agent?

In the original article I offered a pragmatic definition:

> A mobile agent is a software entity designed to perform a well-defined task with minimal user intervention, capable of moving across a network under its own control to reach the resources it needs.

Key traits we highlighted:

- **Autonomy** – once launched, it pursues its goal without continuous supervision.
- **Mobility** – it serialises its state, travels to another host, and resumes execution there.
- **Social abilities** – agents can negotiate, cooperate, or compete with peers.
- **Persistence** – an agent can be deactivated and later resumed exactly where it left off.

The Clippy assistant from Office 97 served as a familiar (if quaint) example of an agent. The difference with *mobile* agents is that they are not tied to one machine; they can carry both code and data to the location where the task is best executed.

## Why Aglets?

IBM Japan released **Aglets** as an experimental framework built on top of the Java Platform. Each agent is a subclass of `Aglet`, and the runtime provides:

- A **context** (the “station”) that hosts agents, keeps them alive, and offers services such as message routing or persistence.
- A **mobility API** to clone, dispatch, retract, or dispose of agents.
- A **communication model** based on asynchronous message passing between agents and contexts.

The SDK embraced Java’s sandbox model, giving mobile code a reasonable security boundary while keeping the programming model approachable for Java developers.

## Threat or opportunity?

Yes, the notion of executable code roaming the Internet sounds like the premise of a virus, and in the paper I acknowledged that fear. The counterargument was (and still is) that the real risk lies on the servers that accept untrusted code. With the right policies, authentication, and resource quotas, mobile agents unlock scenarios such as:

- **Distributed search** – dispatch agents to crawl several intranets and aggregate results.
- **Personal assistants** – send an agent to a remote marketplace to collect offers, negotiate, and return with the best deal.
- **Network management** – push monitoring agents closer to the hardware to react with lower latency.

Part I closed by mapping the conceptual landscape—defining agents, motivations, and expectations. Parts [II](/en/blog/aglets-2/) and [III](/en/blog/aglets-3/) delve into the Aglets life cycle, security architecture, and practical coding examples.
