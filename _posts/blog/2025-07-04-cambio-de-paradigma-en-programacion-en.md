Over the past year my routine as a developer has flipped. I used to spend **90 %** of the day writing code and only **10 %** testing. With assistants like **Codex** or Google’s **Jules**, the work looks completely different.

Today the priority is **decomposing work** into small, parallelisable units so Codex can produce several pull requests at once. While the AI ships those changes, I focus on **reviewing** and **testing** the previous batch, tightening the loop.

My current time split:

- **10–20 %** hands-on coding.
- **30 %** designing independent tasks that the AI can tackle.
- **50–60 %** reviewing, testing, and polishing what the assistant delivers.

Fragmenting the work is now a critical skill. Treat the development process as a conveyor belt of microtasks and you multiply velocity without sacrificing quality—provided validation remains rigorous.

Productivity has skyrocketed: less time hammering out code, more time coordinating, verifying, and designing. This very post follows that automated flow: I recorded a few voice notes with the core ideas and Codex turned them into the text you’re reading.
