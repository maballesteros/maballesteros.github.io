Back in 1994 I was studying physics at the University of Valencia and stumbled onto a chapter by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) that described how to predict a particle’s path numerically. I wanted to see those equations breathe, so I wrote a tiny C program that evolved into **GSF – the Physical Systems Generator**.

The idea was intentionally simple: describe the particles, forces, and initial conditions in text files, let the program iterate the equations, and output new files with the resulting trajectories. Today I would use JSON for everything and pipe the results into a visualisation, but in the mid‑90s a terminal full of numbers already felt like science fiction.

I recently recovered the original source code and uploaded it to [GitHub](http://github.com/maballesteros/generador-sistemas-fisicos). Reading those files is like meeting my younger self—dense comments, handcrafted parsers, and a lot of love for numerical experiments.

### Original documentation (Spanish)

The original package included a small documentation bundle and demo scripts (yes, in Spanish!). If you are curious, start by running `demo001` after compiling the project—you’ll see how the engine links every concept together with nothing more than text files and a bit of imagination.
