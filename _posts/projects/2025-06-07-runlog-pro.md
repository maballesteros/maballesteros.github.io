Today I released [RunLog Pro](/runlog-pro/), a new web application designed to help runners log their running sessions, track their progress, and create personalized training plans based on algorithmic calculations.

You can find the live application at the link above, or review the full source and documentation in the project's [README](/runlog-pro/README.md).
