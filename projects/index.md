As of 2025 all my project write-ups are published as regular blog posts, so they appear in the [main timeline](/blog/) alongside everything else I create.

If you are looking for a specific project, try browsing the blog by tag or use the search in your browserâ€”every historical project article is now part of the unified feed.
