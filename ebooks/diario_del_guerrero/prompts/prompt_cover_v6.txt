A vertical book cover art (9:16 aspect ratio).
Style: Extreme Minimalism. Zen. Negative Space (Ma).
Atmosphere: Absolute silence, clarity, perfection.
Colors: Cream paper texture, deep black ink, and a single vibrant RED accent.

Visuals:
80% of the image is empty space (high-quality textured paper).
At the bottom, a single perfectly executed element: a Katana resting, a falling autumn leaf, or a tiny warrior facing the vastness.
A traditional red seal (hanko) in a corner balances the visual weight.
The simplicity is striking and elegant.

Main Title: "DIARIO DEL GUERRERO" (Small, elegant, discrete serif font)
