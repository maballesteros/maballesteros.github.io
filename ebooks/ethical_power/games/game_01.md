# Game 1: Power Traffic Light 2.0

> **Objective**: Train the capacity to instantly identify the status of a message (submissive, aggressive, assertive) and practice reformulation to a CPS proposal (Context, Proposal, Next step) in real time.

## Players and Roles

*   **The Sender**: Says a sentence with emotional charge (aggressive or submissive).
*   **The Traffic Light**: Raises hand (or card) indicating the color and must correct the sentence.
*   **The Judge (optional)**: Decides if the correction is valid.

## Quick Set-up: Starter phrases

To avoid wasting time thinking "what do I say", the **Sender** can choose one of these phrases at random to start the round.

| Red Phrases (Aggressive) | Amber Phrases (Passive/Victim) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "You always leave everything lying around!" | "No, leave it, I'll pick it up even if it hurts..." |
| "Wake up, you look stupid." | "It's just that nobody helps me in this house, but well." |
| "You have no idea how to do this right." | "I guess my opinion doesn't count, as always." |
| "Shut up and listen to me for once!" | "Don't worry about me, I'm used to it." |
| "This is a disaster and it's your fault." | "If you wanted to go, you should have said, now it doesn't matter." |
| "You are selfish, you only think about yourself!" | "Sure, since you are perfect and I am not..." |
| "Don't give me cheap excuses!" | "Do what you want, I adapt to everything." |
| "Can't you do anything right?" | "I don't care, anyway, for what it's worth..." |
| "I'm sick of having to repeat everything!" | "Sorry to bother, I'll manage alone." |
| "That idea is a monumental stupidity!" | "Well, if you think that's okay..." |

> **Cheat Sheet for the Traffic Light (Your Green goal):**
> 1.  **Stop**: Identify the color (Red/Amber).
> 2.  **CPS**:
>     *   **C**ontext (Facts, without judgment).
>     *   **P**roposal (Clear solution).
>     *   **S**tep Next (Closing or question).

## Mechanics

1.  The **Sender** throws a "dirty" phrase.
    *   Red Example (Aggressive): "You always arrive late, you are a disaster!"
    *   Amber Example (Submissive/Passive): "Well, never mind, I'll do it if anything..."
2.  The **Traffic Light** has 3 seconds to classify it: "Red!" or "Amber!".
3.  Immediately after identifying the color, the **Traffic Light** must convert that phrase to **Green** using the CPS structure.
    *   Correction: "Context: you have arrived late three times. Proposal: let's talk about how to solve it. Does tomorrow work for you?"
4.  If they do it in less than 10 seconds, they win a point. If they block or the phrase remains "dirty", point for the Sender.
5.  Rotate roles every 5 phrases.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)

*   What is harder to correct, aggression (red) or passivity (amber)?
*   Have you noticed how your body changes when you switch to "green"? (Do you breathe better? Do you look in the eyes?).
*   In what real situation this week could you have used your "green converter"?

### Pro Variant

Do it with **real text messages** from your mobiles. Read the last tense message you received and play to answer it in "Green".
