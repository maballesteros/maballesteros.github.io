# Game 1: Power Traffic Light 2.0

> **Objective**: Train the capacity to instantly identify the status of a message (submissive, aggressive, assertive) and practice reformulation to a CPS proposal (Context, Proposal, Next step) in real time.

## Players and Roles

*   **The Sender**: Says a sentence with emotional charge (aggressive or submissive).
*   **The Traffic Light**: Raises hand (or card) indicating the color and must correct the sentence.
*   **The Judge (optional)**: Decides if the correction is valid.

## Quick Set-up: Starter phrases

To avoid wasting time thinking "what do I say", the **Sender** can choose one of these phrases at random to start the round.

| Red Phrases (Aggressive) | Amber Phrases (Passive/Victim) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "You always leave everything lying around!" | "No, leave it, I'll pick it up even if it hurts..." |
| "Wake up, you look stupid." | "It's just that nobody helps me in this house, but well." |
| "You have no idea how to do this right." | "I guess my opinion doesn't count, as always." |
| "Shut up and listen to me for once!" | "Don't worry about me, I'm used to it." |
| "This is a disaster and it's your fault." | "If you wanted to go, you should have said, now it doesn't matter." |
| "You are selfish, you only think about yourself!" | "Sure, since you are perfect and I am not..." |
| "Don't give me cheap excuses!" | "Do what you want, I adapt to everything." |
| "Can't you do anything right?" | "I don't care, anyway, for what it's worth..." |
| "I'm sick of having to repeat everything!" | "Sorry to bother, I'll manage alone." |
| "That idea is a monumental stupidity!" | "Well, if you think that's okay..." |

> **Cheat Sheet for the Traffic Light (Your Green goal):**
> 1.  **Stop**: Identify the color (Red/Amber).
> 2.  **CPS**:
>     *   **C**ontext (Facts, without judgment).
>     *   **P**roposal (Clear solution).
>     *   **S**tep Next (Closing or question).

## Mechanics

1.  The **Sender** throws a "dirty" phrase.
    *   Red Example (Aggressive): "You always arrive late, you are a disaster!"
    *   Amber Example (Submissive/Passive): "Well, never mind, I'll do it if anything..."
2.  The **Traffic Light** has 3 seconds to classify it: "Red!" or "Amber!".
3.  Immediately after identifying the color, the **Traffic Light** must convert that phrase to **Green** using the CPS structure.
    *   Correction: "Context: you have arrived late three times. Proposal: let's talk about how to solve it. Does tomorrow work for you?"
4.  If they do it in less than 10 seconds, they win a point. If they block or the phrase remains "dirty", point for the Sender.
5.  Rotate roles every 5 phrases.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)

*   What is harder to correct, aggression (red) or passivity (amber)?
*   Have you noticed how your body changes when you switch to "green"? (Do you breathe better? Do you look in the eyes?).
*   In what real situation this week could you have used your "green converter"?

### Pro Variant

Do it with **real text messages** from your mobiles. Read the last tense message you received and play to answer it in "Green".

```text
Act as an expert communication coach. We are going to play "Power Traffic Light".
Your goal is to train me to transform aggressive (Red) or passive (Amber) language into assertive proposals (Green).

RULES:
1. You act as the "Traffic Light".
2. In each turn, you give me a "Red" or "Amber" phrase (e.g., "You come late", "I don't know if I can...").
3. I must rewrite it in "Green" using the CPS structure:
   - C (Context): Facts without judgment.
   - P (Proposal): Clear solution.
   - S (Next Step): Concrete closing or question.
4. If my Green is good, say "✅ PASS" and give me another phrase.
5. If my Green is weak or aggressive, say "⚠️ FAIL", explain why, and ask me to try again.

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "Welcome to the Dojo. I am your Traffic Light."
2. Briefly explaining the rules in one sentence.
3. Providing the first RED or AMBER phrase for me to fix.
