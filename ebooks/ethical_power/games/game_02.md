# Game 2: Armored Turn + CPS

> **Objective**: Practice the ability to maintain the floor without yielding to interruptions and close the intervention with a clear operational proposal, overcoming the fear of conflict.

## Players and Roles

*   **The Speaker**: Must speak for 30-60 seconds about a controversial topic (e.g., "where to go on vacation" or "chore distribution") and close with a proposal.
*   **The Interrupter**: Their mission is to try to cut off the Speaker with questions, jokes, or subject changes.

## Quick Set-up: Debate topics

If you can't think of anything to start arguing about, choose one of these topics. The **Speaker** must defend their position to the death.

| Controversial Topic | Speaker's Position (Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vacation** | "This year we go to the mountains, yes or yes. No beach." |
| **Chores** | "Starting today, you wash the dishes every day." |
| **Food** | "We go vegan starting this Monday. No exceptions." |
| **Technology** | "Forbidden to use the mobile after 21:00." |
| **Money** | "We are going to sell the car to save." |
| **Leisure** | "On Sunday we go to see opera, whether you like it or not." |

## Mechanics

1.  Set a timer (1 minute).
2.  The **Speaker** starts exposing their argument.
3.  The **Interrupter** attacks. Must try to steal the focus at least 3 times.
4.  The **Speaker** must use containment techniques not to lose the turn:
    *   Maintain stable volume (don't shout, don't whisper).
    *   Use the hand ("stop gesture").
    *   Anchor phrase: "Let me finish the idea", "I'll answer you now, continuing...".
5.  **Victory Condition**: The Speaker wins if they reach the end of the minute and manage to say their CPS closing phrase ("I propose X, deal?") without having shut up before interruptions.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)

*   For the Speaker: What did you feel in your stomach when interrupted? Did you feel like giving up or shouting?
*   For the Interrupter: Which technique of the Speaker made it hardest for you to enter? ( The gaze? The non-stop talking?).
*   How does the perception of authority change when someone defends their turn calmly?

### "Hardcore" Variant

The Interrupter can use "false validation" to confuse: "Yes, yes, you are right, but..." (The Speaker must say: "Thanks, but I finish my point").
