# Game 4: Joke or Disqualification

> **Objective**: Train the "Covert Aggression Detector" to quickly distinguish between a friendly joke and a status attack, and react proportionally.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Screenwriter)**: Reads phrases from a list (some neutral, others rude).
*   **Role B (The Detector)**: Classifies and responds.

## Quick Set-up: The Script

The **Screenwriter** reads one of these phrases. The **Detector** must shout the color.

| Phrase | Tone / Intention | Correct Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Hey, that shirt looks good on you." | Sincere / Compliment | **GREEN** |
| "Wow, how brave coming dressed like that..." | Sarcasm / Judgment | **RED** |
| "Pass me the salt, please?" | Neutral request | **GREEN** |
| "Let's see if you learn to pass the salt without spilling it." | Paternalism / Scolding | **RED** |
| "You look a bit tired, are you okay?" | Real concern | **GREEN** |
| "You look terrible today, don't you?" | False concern / Attack | **RED** |
| "Thanks for the report, good job." | Gratitude | **GREEN** |
| "Finally you deliver something decent." | Praise with implicit insult | **RED** |
| "Can we talk for a moment?" | Conversation proposal | **GREEN** |
| "We need to talk (sigh)..." | Anxiety generation | **RED** |

## Mechanics
1.  The Screenwriter says a phrase with ambiguous tone.
    *   Ex 1: "Some hair you have today".
    *   Ex 2: "Thank goodness you are here, Einstein".
2.  The Detector must shout **"GREEN"** (Friendly) or **"RED"** (Attack) in less than 2 seconds.
    *   If GREEN: Smile and continue.
    *   If RED: Launch a neutral meta-comment ("That comment is unnecessary", "Where is that coming from?", "I ignore the tone").

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Is it harder to detect or respond?
*   Were you afraid of seeming "too sensitive" when marking a RED?

### Variant
Play with eyes closed to guide yourself only by the tone of voice (paralanguage).
