# Game 10: Anti-Teacher-Pupil

> **Objective**: Detect when someone is giving you unsolicited lessons (framing you as student/ignorant) and re-establish the equal-to-equal frame.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Teacher)**: Explains obvious things with a condescending tone. "Look, this is done like this, let me teach you...".
*   **Role B (The Peer)**: Breaks the student frame.

## Quick Set-up: Teacher's Lessons

The **Teacher** chooses a phrase to lay down the law. The **Peer** must break the frame.

| Condescending Phrase (Teacher) | Hidden Intention |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Let's see, let me explain how this really goes." | Assuming the other doesn't know. |
| "You are doing well, but for your level..." | Toxic praise (low expectation). |
| "When you have been here as long as I have, you will understand..." | Seniority argument. |
| "Don't worry, I'll handle it since it's complicated." | Paternalism / Disabling. |
| "It's adorable that you try to do it like that." | Infantilization. |
| "I'm going to give you some free advice..." | Unasked advice = Superiority. |
| "Have you read the book I told you? Can tell you didn't." | Public exam. |

## Mechanics
1.  The Teacher starts their sermon.
2.  The Peer must interrupt gently using **Validation + Expert Contribution** or **Meta-comment** techniques:
    *   *Technique 1 (I also know)*: "Yes, I know theory X. In fact, my focus here is Y for Z reason."
    *   *Technique 2 (Closing)*: "Concept understood. Let's move to execution."
    *   *Technique 3 (Soft Irony)*: "Thanks for the masterclass, prof. Back to work."
3.  If B stays silent nodding, loses. Must verbalize their competence.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Do you notice how the "Teacher" grows if you don't stop them?
*   Which phrase feels most natural to you to say "I already know this" without being arrogant?

```text
Act as "The Condescending Teacher". We are going to play "Anti-Teacher-Pupil".
Your goal is to treat me like an ignorant junior.

RULES:
1. You talk to me with paternalism, explaining obvious things ("Let me explain how a computer works...", "It's cute that you try").
2. I must BREAK THE FRAME using:
   - Expert Contribution ("I know that theory, I apply it like this...").
   - Soft Irony ("Thanks for the class, Prof.").
   - Closing ("Understood. Moving on.").
3. If I just say "okay" or get angry, say "❌ I still own the frame. Try again."
4. If I re-establish my status as an equal/expert, say "✅ FRAME BROKEN. You graduated."

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "Take a seat, let me teach you something."
2. Giving me your first condescending lesson about my job.
