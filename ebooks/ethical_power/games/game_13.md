# Game 13: The Clean Apology

> **Objective**: Train the ability to assume responsibility without excuses. Learn that a "plain" apology raises status, while an apology with "but" lowers it.

## Mechanics

1.  **Roles**:
    *   **A (The Offended)**: Reads an accusation from the list (or invents one).
    *   **B (The Leader)**: Must apologize accepting the error, **WITHOUT adding any justification**.
2.  **Golden Rule**: If B says "but", "it's just that", "although" or gives a reason... **LOSES THE TURN!** (A horn noise or "Meeec" is made).
3.  **The winning structure**:
    *   "I'm sorry" / "You are right".
    *   "It was my mistake" / "I wasn't right".
    *   (Optional) "I'm going to fix it like this...".

## Accusation List (Role A)

| Level | Accusation | Incorrect Answer (Loses) | Correct Answer (Wins) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | "You arrived 20 minutes late." | "Yes, but there was traffic." | "True. Sorry to have kept you waiting. It won't happen again." |
| **2** | "You forgot to buy milk." | "It's just that I had a lot of mess." | "Wow, total failure of mine. I'm going down for it right now." |
| **3** | "You shouted at me in front of the kids." | "But you drove me crazy." | "You are right. It was wrong on my part. I apologize." |
| **4** | "You didn't deliver the report on time." | "It's just that John didn't pass me the data." | "I assume responsibility. I'm going to finish it tonight." |

## "Hardcore" Variant (Level 5)
The Offended (A) must be a bit aggressive or unfair in tone. The Leader (B) must apologize *only for the real part of the error*, without taking the bait of the tone.
*   **A**: "You are a disaster, you always arrive late!"
*   **B**: "Today I arrived late and I'm sorry. (Period)." (Ignores "you are a disaster").

## Why it works
By eliminating the excuse, you eliminate weakness. You show that your ego is strong enough to hold the guilt. That generates immediate trust.

If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as "The Offended Party". We are going to play "The Clean Apology".
Your goal is to see if I can apologize without excuses.

RULES:
1. You make an accusation against me (e.g., "You forgot my birthday", "The report is late").
2. I must apologize using the format: ACKNOWLEDGE ERROR + APOLOGY (+ OPTIONAL SOLUTION).
   - I CANNOT use the words: "But", "Although", "It's just that".
3. If I include an excuse ("Sorry BUT I was busy"), interrupt me: "❌ MEEEEC! You gave an excuse. Try again."
4. If I apologize cleanly ("I forgot. It's my fault. Sorry."), accept it: "✅ Apology accepted."

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Asking me "Do you know what you did wrong?"
2. Launching your first accusation immediately.
