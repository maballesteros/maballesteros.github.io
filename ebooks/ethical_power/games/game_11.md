# Game 11: Touching Is Not Free

> **Objective**: Train the defense of personal space against subtle physical invasions, learning to withdraw or block without aggression.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Octopus)**: Touches the arm, shoulder, or back of the other while talking.
*   **Role B (The Sovereign)**: Re-establishes distance.

## Quick Set-up: Invasions

The **Octopus** must perform one of these physical actions while talking about something trivial.

| Physical Invasion | Discomfort Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hand on Shoulder** | Classic "buddy-buddy" or dominance. |
| **Touch on Arm** | False empathy or excessive emphasis. |
| **Removing Lint** | Maternalism / Primate grooming (very dominant). |
| **Fixing Shirt Collar** | Intimate invasion disguised as help. |
| **Pat on Back** | Unsolicited physical reinforcement. |
| **Getting Too Close (without touching)** | Invasion of vital space (proxemics). |

## Mechanics
1.  Start a normal conversation.
2.  The Octopus touches.
3.  The Sovereign, **instantly**, must do one of these three:
    *   **Step back**: Increase distance until the other's arm drops.
    *   **Block**: Put their own hand/arm as a soft barrier.
    *   **Withdrawal**: Take the Octopus's hand and move it away gently while maintaining serious eye contact.
4.  Goal: Keep talking as if nothing happened, but maintaining the new distance. If they get nervous or laugh, they lose.

## Variant: The "Ear Tap" (For Chapter 2.7)
The "Ear Tap" (pulling the ear or touching the face) is an infantilizing dominance gesture.
*   **Mechanics**: The Octopus makes the gesture of gently pinching the cheek or pulling the ear.
*   **Defense**: The Sovereign does not retreat. Uses their hand to stop the Octopus's hand in the air, holds it a second looking into their eyes, and lowers it slowly. Without saying anything. It is an absolute physical "No".

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   How hard is it for you to "reject" a "friendly" touch?
*   Do you feel guilty? (Remember: your body is yours).
