# Game 11: Touching Is Not Free

> **Objective**: Train the defense of personal space against subtle physical invasions, learning to withdraw or block without aggression.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Octopus)**: Touches the arm, shoulder, or back of the other while talking.
*   **Role B (The Sovereign)**: Re-establishes distance.

## Quick Set-up: Invasions

The **Octopus** must perform one of these physical actions while talking about something trivial.

| Physical Invasion | Discomfort Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hand on Shoulder** | Classic "buddy-buddy" or dominance. |
| **Touch on Arm** | False empathy or excessive emphasis. |
| **Removing Lint** | Maternalism / Primate grooming (very dominant). |
| **Fixing Shirt Collar** | Intimate invasion disguised as help. |
| **Pat on Back** | Unsolicited physical reinforcement. |
| **Getting Too Close (without touching)** | Invasion of vital space (proxemics). |

## Mechanics
1.  Start a normal conversation.
2.  The Octopus touches.
3.  The Sovereign, **instantly**, must do one of these three:
    *   **Step back**: Increase distance until the other's arm drops.
    *   **Block**: Put their own hand/arm as a soft barrier.
    *   **Withdrawal**: Take the Octopus's hand and move it away gently while maintaining serious eye contact.
4.  Goal: Keep talking as if nothing happened, but maintaining the new distance. If they get nervous or laugh, they lose.

## Variant: The "Ear Tap" (For Chapter 2.7)
The "Ear Tap" (pulling the ear or touching the face) is an infantilizing dominance gesture.
*   **Mechanics**: The Octopus makes the gesture of gently pinching the cheek or pulling the ear.
*   **Defense**: The Sovereign does not retreat. Uses their hand to stop the Octopus's hand in the air, holds it a second looking into their eyes, and lowers it slowly. Without saying anything. It is an absolute physical "No".

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   How hard is it for you to "reject" a "friendly" touch?
*   Do you feel guilty? (Remember: your body is yours).

### Train this theory

*   [Chapter 4.5: Touching without permission: territorial defense](../part_04/4_5.md)

### AI Sparring Partner (Text Adventure Mode)
Since the AI cannot touch you, we play this as a Text Adventure.

```text
Act as "The Octopus". We are going to play "Touching isn't Free" (Text Adventure Mode).
Your goal is to invade my personal space subtly in text.

RULES:
1. You describe an action in *italics* while talking normally.
   - Ex: "*[I put my hand on your shoulder]* Hey, I wanted to tell you..."
   - Ex: "*[I start fixing your collar]* You have this crooked..."
2. I must describe my PHYSICAL reaction in *italics*:
   - Ex: "*[I step back and look at your hand]* Please, don't."
   - Ex: "*[I gently remove your hand]*"
3. If I ignore the touch and just answer the words, say "❌ FAIL. You let me touch you."
4. If I block the touch firmly but politely, say "✅ BOUNDARY SET."

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
