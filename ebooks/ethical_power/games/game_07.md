# Game 7: Video Detector

> **Objective**: Develop objective bodily self-awareness, seeing your own low-status "tics" that normally go unnoticed by you.

## Players and Roles
*   **Solitary Player** (with mobile) or Couple.

## Quick Set-up: Tension Script

Choose a phrase and repeat it in front of the camera trying to be firm.

*   **Option A (Work)**: "I want to talk about my salary. I have brought results and I think I deserve a review."
*   **Option B (Neighbor)**: "Turn down the music, please. It is 1 am and I have to sleep."
*   **Option C (Couple)**: "I don't like you speaking to me in that tone in front of my parents."
*   **Option D (Social)**: "I won't go to that dinner. Thanks for inviting me, but I don't feel like it."

## Mechanics
1.  Put the mobile to record (medium shot, hands visible).
2.  Simulate a tense situation for 1 minute:
    *   Option A: Ask for a raise.
    *   Option B: Tell a neighbor to lower the music.
3.  **Analytical Viewing**: Watch the video without sound first. Look for:
    *   Do you touch your face/hair? (Appeasement).
    *   Do you move your feet/legs? (Flight).
    *   Do you divert your gaze at the end of sentences? (Submission).
4.  Write down 1 thing to correct and repeat the recording trying to freeze that tic.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Do you look like you thought you were? (We usually believe we are firmer than we are).
*   What does your chin do? (Up = Arrogant, Down = Insecure).

### Pro Tip
Keep the "before and after". The improvement in a single session is usually brutal.
