# Why Games? The Laboratory of Power

Reading about swimming doesn't prevent you from drowning. Reading about power doesn't prevent you from freezing when your boss yells at you.

This section is the **Dojo**. It is the place where you train techniques in a safe environment so that when you go out into the real world (the street), your reaction is automatic.

## How to use this section

1.  **Don't just read**: These files are scripts for action. If you read them on the sofa, you are wasting your time.
2.  **Find a Sparring Partner**: Most games require two people. Ask a friend, your partner, or a trusted colleague to play with you for 10 minutes. It's fun and you both learn.
3.  **Use Artificial Intelligence**: If you are embarrassed to practice with a human or don't have anyone handy, we have added a **"Prompt for AI"** in the first games. You just have to copy the text, paste it into ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude, and the AI will play the role of the "Troll" or the "Evaluator". It is the perfect way to start without fear of judgment.
4.  **Use the Mirror**: If you are alone, many games (like the "No" or the Presentation) can be done in front of a mirror or recording yourself with your mobile.
5.  **Accept the Ridicule**: It is better to stutter here, playing a game, than to stutter in a salary negotiation. Fail here to win there.

## The Philosophy of "Drilling"

In martial arts, a "Drill" is a movement repeated until it comes out without thinking.
We want you to internalize the **CPS**, the **Clean No**, and the **Frame Control** until they are muscle memory.

Choose a game. Set the timer. Play.
