# Game 9: Group Landing

> **Objective**: Learn to intervene in a disordered group conversation to synthesize, validate, and advance, gaining status as a facilitator leader.

## Players and Roles
*   **Roles A, B, C (The Noise)**: Speak at once, change subject, argue.
*   **Role D (The Control Tower)**: Has to land the plane (the group).

## Quick Set-up: The Chaos

The group must start arguing heatedly about one of these ridiculous topics.

| Discussion Topic | Roles (The Noise) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Christmas Dinner** | A: "Vegan". B: "Only meat". C: "Cheap". |
| **Birthday Gift** | A: "Clothes". B: "Experience". C: "Money in envelope". |
| **Travel Destination** | A: "Relax beach". B: "Adventure mountain". C: "Urban tourism". |
| **Project Name** | A: "Cool English". B: "Classic Spanish". C: "Weird acronym". |
| **Office Color** | A: "Nuclear white". B: "Corporate colors". C: "Wallpaper". |

## Mechanics
1.  The group starts arguing about "where we dine" mixing topics (soccer, money, allergies). A scripted chaos.
2.  The Control Tower waits for the moment, raises hand (visual gesture) and says:
    *   "Time. (Silence). I've heard three options: A, B and C. We discard A for expensive. B and C remain. We vote now. Who wants B?"
3.  The goal is to achieve that the group votes and decides in less than 2 minutes of intervention.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Did you feel fear of interrupting? (It is the main barrier).
*   Did the group feel commanded or relieved? (The good leader relieves, does not oppress).

### Pro Tip
Use people's names when summarizing. "As John was saying..." + "As Mary was saying...". That validates you as a listener and gives you the right to close.
