# Game 3: Lightning Re-frame

> **Objective**: Develop mental agility to detect a negative or manipulative frame and re-define it instantly in favor of the common goal.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The "Troll")**: Throws complaints, blame, or negative frames.
*   **Role B (The Leader)**: Re-frames and returns the ball.

## Quick Set-up: Attack Phrases

The **Troll** must stand chooses one of these phrases to launch their initial attack. Don't think about it, just throw it.

| Troll Phrase | Negative Frame Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| "You always want to be right about everything." | **Identity Attack** (You are arrogant). |
| "This is a total waste of time." | **Process Attack** (Uselessness). |
| "What you are is selfish." | **Labeling** (Moral judgment). |
| "If you cared about the project, you would do this." | **Emotional Blackmail** (Guilt). |
| "What nonsense you just said." | **Disqualification** (Ridicule). |
| "You have no idea what you're talking about." | **Competence Attack** (Authority). |
| "Here we go again with your quirks." | **Generalization** (Negative history). |
| "And what would you know?" | **Status Challenge** (Hierarchy). |
| "That's not going to work, as always." | **Self-fulfilling Prophecy** (Pessimism). |
| "Do it however you want, I don't care." | **Passive-Aggressive** (False withdrawal). |

## Mechanics
1.  **The Troll** throws a short phrase with poison (e.g., "You always arrive late", "This is a waste of time", "You are selfish").
2.  **The Leader** has **3 seconds** to respond with a phrase starting with:
    *   "It is not X, it is Y..."
    *   "I understand you are worried about X; my goal is Y..."
    *   "Do we want X or do we want Y?"
3.  If they take more than 3 seconds or justify themselves ("it's not true..."), lose point. If they re-frame towards the goal, gain point.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   What do you feel in your stomach when the accusation is thrown at you? (Normalize the stress spike).
*   Which "template" phrase worked best for you?

### Pro Tip
Don't try to convince the Troll they are wrong. Simply change the conversation topic.
*   Troll: "You are annoying".
*   Leader: "I am persistent because I want this to turn out well. Shall we continue?"

### AI Sparring Partner
If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as a "Social Troll". We are going to play "Lightning Re-frame".
Your goal is to train me to deflect verbal attacks without getting angry or defensive.

RULES:
1. You throw a "Toxic Phrase" at me (Attack on my competence, identity, or past).
   - Ex: "You are selfish", "This is a disaster".
2. I must respond with a "Positive Re-frame" (change meaning to future/solution) in less than 7 words.
   - Bad: "It's not true" (Defensive).
   - Good: "It's not selfishness, it's self-care" (Re-frame).
3. If I defend myself, say "❌ FAIL" and explain why.
4. If I re-frame well, say "✅ POINT" and throw the next attack immediately.

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "Welcome to the Re-frame Dojo."
2. Throwing the first toxic phrase at me to answer.
