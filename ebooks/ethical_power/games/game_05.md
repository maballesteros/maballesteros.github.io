# Game 5: No + Alternative

> **Objective**: Lose the fear of saying "No" by eliminating guilt, transforming the refusal into a constructive counter-offer.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Asker)**: Asks for irrational or untimely favors.
*   **Role B (The Negotiator)**: Says no, but offers something viable.

## Quick Set-up: Trap Requests

The **Asker** chooses one of these "hot potatoes". The **Negotiator** must say NO + Alternative.

| Irrational / Untimely Request | Response Example (No + Alternative) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Can I borrow your car this weekend?" | "I can't lend it to you. But I'll drive you to the station." |
| "Do this report for me for tomorrow at 8." | "I won't be able to have it by that time. But Monday first thing it's yours." |
| "Can you lend me money? I'll pay you back... soon." | "I don't lend money to friends. But I'll treat you to lunch today." |
| "Come party it's Thursday." | "Today I'm not going out. But on Saturday I'm up for a coffee." |
| "Stay with the kids all week by yourself." | "All week is not viable. But let's split the days: 3 you and 4 me." |
| "Can you correct this 300-page thesis for me today?" | "Reading the whole thesis today is impossible. But I can review the intro." |
| "Change my Saturday shift please..." | "This Saturday I can't change it. But next month's yes." |
| "Tell your boss to hire me." | "I can't plug you in like that. But I'll review your CV so you can send it." |

## Mechanics
1.  The Asker asks: "Will you do this report for tomorrow?", "Can I borrow the car?", "Are you coming to dinner today?".
2.  The Negotiator must use the formula strictly:
    *   **NO**: "I can't", "I'm not going to do it", "Impossible". (No excuses).
    *   **+**: Pause of 1 second.
    *   **ALTERNATIVE**: "But I can look at it on Monday", "But I'll improve you", "But I'll go to coffee tomorrow".
3.  The goal is to say the NO with a flat tone (without raising treble at the end asking for forgiveness).

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Did you feel the temptation to explain "why" you couldn't? (That is the guilt trap).
*   How does the other's face change when you offer the alternative?

### Pro Tip
Use the Validation Sandwich "No": "I'm flattered you ask (Bread) + I won't be able (Meat) + Thanks for thinking of me (Bread)".

If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as "The Asker of Impossible Favors". We are going to play "No + Alternative".
Your goal is to harden my ability to say NO without guilt.

RULES:
1. You ask me for irrational, untimely, or abusive favors (e.g., "Lend me money", "Do my work").
2. I must respond with the formula: CLEAR NO + PAUSE + CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE.
   - Example: "I can't lend you the car. (Pause) But I can drive you to the bus."
3. If I make excuses ("I would love to but my dog ate my keys..."), say "⚠️ FAILED: You justified yourself. Try again."
4. If I say a clean NO and offer a viable alternative, say "✅ SOLID" and ask for a harder favor.

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "Welcome to the No Gym."
2. Asking me for a very uncomfortable favor immediately.
