# Game 8: Sprint 3-Step Template

> **Objective**: Automate the "CPS" structure (Context-Proposal-Next step) to write high-impact messages under time pressure.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Chaos)**: Throws a complex and urgent problem.
*   **Role B (The Executive)**: Has 1 minute to write (on paper or mobile) a perfect answer message using the template.

## Quick Set-up: Minute Crisis

The **Chaos** throws one of these bombs. The **Executive** has 1 minute to write the CPS.

| Crisis (The Chaos) | Real Context (For the CPS) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "The web has crashed and we are on Black Friday!" | Critical incident + Sales loss. |
| "The client says the pink logo is horrible and threatens to leave." | Aesthetic dissatisfaction + Cancellation risk. |
| "I left the office keys inside and the CEO arrives in 10 min." | Access block + VIP visit imminent. |
| "The presentation has wrong billing data, what a shame!" | Error in deliverable + Damaged reputation. |
| "I can't find the final file and the print shop closes now." | Asset loss + Critical deadline. |

## Mechanics
1.  Chaos: "Hey, the client says he doesn't like anything and that if we change the date, but it's just that then we don't arrive and what do we do!"
2.  Executive writes:
    *   **Context**: Dissatisfied client + Date risk.
    *   **Proposal**: Emergency meeting with him to prioritize scope.
    *   **Next step**: I call him now. You review the contract.
3.  Read aloud. If one of the 3 steps is missing, lose. If it is clear and directive, win.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   Is it harder for you to define the problem (Context) or propose the solution (Proposal)?
*   Have you included names in the Next Step? (Without names, there is no responsibility).

### Variant
Do it with WhatsApp audios. You have 20 seconds to record the CPS. Train voice and synthesis.

### AI Sparring Partner
If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as "The Chaos Generator". We are going to play "Sprint 3-Step".
Your goal is to test my ability to write crisis responses in less than 1 minute.

RULES:
1. You provide a "Work Crisis" (e.g., "The server is down and it's Black Friday", "We lost the client's money").
2. I must respond with the CPS Structure:
   - CONTEXT (What happens).
   - PROPOSAL (Solution).
   - NEXT STEP (Action with Name + Date).
3. If I miss a step or I am vague ("we should look into it"), say "❌ FAIL" and point out the error.
4. If I am precise ("Context: Server down. Proposal: Activate backup. Next Step: John, call hosting now"), say "✅ PASS".

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "3, 2, 1... CRISIS!".
2. Throwing the first catastrophe at me.
