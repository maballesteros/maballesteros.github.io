# Game 14: The Iron Sandwich

> **Objective**: Practice "Power + Warmth" communication. Learn to say NO or mark a hard boundary, wrapped in genuine human connection.

## Mechanics

1.  **The Sandwich**:
    *   **Top Bread (Warmth)**: Validation, sincere praise, connection.
    *   **Meat (Boundary/Power)**: The "No", the refusal, the clear order.
    *   **Bottom Bread (Warmth)**: Positive closing, well wishes, offer of something else.
2.  **The Challenge**: Role A asks for something difficult or annoying. Role B must refuse using the Sandwich.
3.  **Success Criteria**: Role A must feel that **they have been told no**, but **they like** Role B.

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The impossible favor
*   **A**: "Hey, can you stay to close the office today? I have a date."
*   **B (Bad - Only Power)**: "No, today I can't." (Dry).
*   **B (Bad - Only Warmth)**: "Oh, I'd love to... it's just that I just can't... I'm very sorry..." (Weak).
*   **B (Sandwich)**:
    1.  "I understand you have the date, have a great time!" (Warmth).
    2.  "Today I can't stay, I have a mess." (Firm boundary).
    3.  "Ask Louis, maybe he can. Good luck!" (Warmth).

### Scenario 2: The family invitation
*   **A (Mother-in-law/Mother)**: "Are you coming to lunch on Sunday? I made paella."
*   **B (Sandwich)**:
    1.  "That looks great, thanks for inviting us mom!" (Warmth).
    2.  "This Sunday we need to rest and we are going to stay home quiet." (Boundary).
    3.  "But I want to see you. Will you stop by on Tuesday for a coffee?" (Warmth).

### Scenario 3: Client asks for discount
*   **A**: "It goes out of our price. We need a 20% reduction."
*   **B (Sandwich)**:
    1.  "I love working with you and I want this to go ahead." (Warmth).
    2.  "We can't go down to 20% without touching quality, and that is a red line." (Boundary).
    3.  "What I can do is give you an extra payment term. Does that help?" (Warmth/Alternative).

## Notes for the Facilitator
Look at the tone of voice. Many people put on a "guilty" voice when giving the boundary. The goal is to give the boundary with a normal voice, and the warmth with a smiling voice.

### AI Sparring Partner
If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as the "Needy Friend/Client". We are going to play "The Iron Sandwich".
Your goal is to ask for difficult favors and evaluate my "No".

RULES:
1. You ask for a difficult favor (e.g., "Work on weekend", "Lend money").
2. I must respond with the SANDWICH:
   - Top Bun: Warmth/Validation ("I love that you ask...").
   - Meat: Clean NO (Without excuses).
   - Bottom Bun: Warmth/Alternative ("But let's do this other thing...").
3. If my No is dry (Only Meat), say "❌ Too cold."
4. If my No is weak (Mushy Bread), say "❌ Too soft."
5. If I balance Power + Warmth, say "✅ Perfect Sandwich."

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Asking me for a big, annoying favor.
