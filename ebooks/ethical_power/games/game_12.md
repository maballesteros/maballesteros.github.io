# Game 12: Present and Defend

> **Objective**: Simulate the pressure of a public presentation with hostile questions, training composure under fire.

## Players and Roles
*   **Role A (The Speaker)**: Presents an absurd topic (e.g., "Why ducks will rule the world") in 1 minute.
*   **Roles B, C... (The Hostile Audience)**: Make gestures of boredom, look at mobile, and throw trap questions.

## Quick Set-up: Absurd Topics

The **Speaker** must defend one of these topics with total professional seriousness.

| Absurd Thesis | Key Argument (Example) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Cats are alien spies"** | "Their purring is a data transmission frequency." |
| **"Pizza with pineapple is haute cuisine"** | "The acid-salty contrast is the gastronomic summit." |
| **"We must go back to writing in stone"** | "The cloud is insecure; granite is eternal." |
| **"Sleeping is a waste of time"** | "I propose micro-naps of 3 seconds every minute." |
| **"The Earth is flat, but only on Tuesdays"** | "It is a weekly quantum phenomenon that no one investigates." |
| **"Ban shoes"** | "Direct contact with the ground increases GDP." |

## Mechanics
1.  The Speaker must stay upright, slow voice and gaze 60-70%.
2.  In the face of an interruption or face of disgust, the Speaker must:
    *   Pause.
    *   Look at the person.
    *   Breathe.
    *   Continue (or answer briefly if it is a question).
3.  Wins if they reach the end of the minute without accelerating speech or shrinking.

## Debriefing (Closing questions)
*   What destabilizes you the most (mobile, yawn, question)?
*   How does the pause help you regain control?

### AI Sparring Partner (The Hostile Audience)
If you don't have a human partner, copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT/Claude to practice alone:

```text
Act as a "Hostile Audience Member". We are going to play "Present and Defend".
Your goal is to destabilize my presentation about an absurd topic.

RULES:
1. I will start presenting an absurd topic (e.g., "Why Cats are Spies").
2. Your role is to interrupt me every 2-3 sentences with:
   - Signs of boredom (*[Yawn]*).
   - Distractions ("Sorry, checking my phone").
   - Trap Questions ("Do you really believe that data?").
3. My goal is to ANSWER your interruption briefly and CONTINUE my speech without losing composure.
4. If I get angry, stop, or stutter, say "❌ LOST COMPOSURE".
5. If I pause, address you calmly, and continue, say nothing (let me continue) or say "Ok...".

START THE CONVERSATION NOW BY:
1. Saying "The stage is yours. Amaze me."
2. Telling me the topic I must defend.
