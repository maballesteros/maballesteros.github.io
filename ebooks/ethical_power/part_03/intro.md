# Part 3: Frames and Boundaries

Every social conflict is, at its core, a battle of frames. Whoever defines the frame defines the reality of the interaction.

In this part you will discover how to:

*   Identify the invisible **frame** operating in a conversation.
*   **Re-frame** disadvantageous situations in a few words.
*   Name the **subtext** without being aggressive.
*   Set clean boundaries (`No` + Alternative) and behavioral ones.
*   **Repair** relationships after a conflict.

You will learn to protect your psychological territory without needing to raise impassable walls.
