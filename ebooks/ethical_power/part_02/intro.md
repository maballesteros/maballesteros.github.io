# Part 2: Tone, Timing, and Closings

Power is, to a large extent, the control of time and rhythm. In this section we will focus on the "music" of the interaction.

You will learn to:

*   Use **silence and latency** as tools of power.
*   Ask **framing questions** that shape reality in your favor.
*   Ask for time to think without losing status.
*   Execute **operational closings** and resets when a conversation stagnates.
*   Read and neutralize subtle non-verbal signals.

Mastering time means stopping reacting in a hurry and starting to respond with deliberation.
