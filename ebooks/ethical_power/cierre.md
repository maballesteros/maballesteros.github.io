# Closing

If anything you have read here makes you harder, more cynical or more distrustful, stop. That was not the path.

If, instead, you feel clearer, calmer and more capable of saying "this yes" and "this no" without trembling or attacking, you are doing well.

Power well understood is not noticeable on the outside.
It is noticeable in that things get ordered, relationships breathe and you don't have to prove anything.

That is the only power worth learning.
