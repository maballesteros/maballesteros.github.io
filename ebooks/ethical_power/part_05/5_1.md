# 5.1 10 Frame Control Techniques: Your Swiss Army Knife

> **Learning Objective**: Have an arsenal of quick responses for the 10 most common "Frame Loss" situations. This is a "Cheat Sheet" to print and memorize.

## Story

Mike reviews his emergency card before entering the Final Meeting with the CEO, known for tearing people apart.
The CEO attacks as soon as he enters: "Why should I keep paying you if the market is falling?"

Mike doesn't stutter. He uses the **[Value Re-frame]**:
—Precisely because of that. Because in a falling market, I save you triple what I cost you.

The CEO snorts: "You are arrogant".

Mike ignores the emotional bait. Applies **[Selective Attention]**:
—Could be. Returning to the savings I mentioned... —and he puts the report on the table.

The CEO smiles, recognizing an equal. "Well played. Sit down". Mike hasn't won by being "smart", but by having tools.

Mike is not smarter than before. He just has better tools.

## Deep Explanation

Frame Control is not magic, it is technique. Here are the 10 tools that cover 90% of cases.

### 1. Mirroring
*   **Situation**: They say something absurd or aggressive.
*   **Technique**: Repeat their last 3 words with a questioning tone.
*   **Example**: "This is unacceptable." -> "Unacceptable?" (Forces them to explain themselves and they usually lower the tone or get confused).

### 2. Literal Interpretation
*   **Situation**: Sarcasm or hint.
*   **Technique**: Respond to the literal meaning of words.
*   **Example**: "How smart you are (sarcastic tone)." -> "Thanks, I try to study a lot." (Deactivates irony).

### 3. The Meta-Frame (Zoom Out)
*   **Situation**: Circular argument about stupid details.
*   **Technique**: Talk about the argument itself.
*   **Example**: "We've been arguing for 20 minutes over 5 euros. Our time is worth more. Shall we call it a draw and move on?"

### 4. The Calibration Question
*   **Situation**: They attack or pressure you.
*   **Technique**: Ask for their intention.
*   **Example**: "Is your goal to help me improve or just to vent?"

### 5. The Pedagogical "No"
*   **Situation**: They ask for something impossible.
*   **Technique**: Ask them to solve the problem themselves.
*   **Example**: "How am I supposed to do that with zero budget?" (You return the hot potato).

### 6. Ignore the Bait (Selective Attention)
*   **Situation**: Insult + Argument.
*   **Technique**: Ignore the insult, respond to the argument.
*   **Example**: "You are useless, the report is wrong". -> "Let's see where the error is in the report."

### 7. Active Silence
*   **Situation**: They make you a ridiculous offer or a threat.
*   **Technique**: Look them in the eye and shut up for 5 seconds.
*   **Effect**: They feel obliged to speak to fill the void and usually yield.

### 8. Emotion Validation
*   **Situation**: Someone hysterical.
*   **Technique**: Validate the emotion, not the reason.
*   **Example**: "I see you are very angry and I understand it." (You don't say "you are right", you say "I see your anger"). Lowers the defense.

### 9. Re-labeling
*   **Situation**: They put a bad label on you ("You are slow").
*   **Technique**: Change label ("I am meticulous").
*   **Effect**: You recover the definition of your identity.

### 10. Strategic Withdrawal
*   **Situation**: You have lost the frame and they are crushing you.
*   **Technique**: "I have to go to the bathroom / I have a call".
*   **Effect**: You cut the dynamic. You return 5 minutes later with the frame reset.

## Synthesis of Key Ideas

*   **Memorization**: These techniques are useless if you have them in a PDF. You have to have them on the tip of your tongue. Choose 3 and use them this week.
*   **The right tool**: Don't use a hammer (Aggressive Silence) for a screw (A sad friend). Calibrate.

## Practical Examples

### 1. In a salary negotiation
*   **Boss**: "The market is bad."
*   **You (Meta-Frame)**: "The general market may be, but the value I brought in project X is specific. Let's talk about that."

### 2. Angry partner
*   **Partner**: "You always do the same!"
*   **You (Mirror)**: "Always?"
*   **Partner**: "Well, not always, but this week..." (You have already lowered the exaggeration).

## Signs of Progress

1.  **You don't go blank anymore**:
    *   *Do you always have something to say?* Before you blocked. Now, in the worst case, you use Mirroring or Silence. You always have an exit.
2.  **You have fun**:
    *   *Do you experiment?* "Today I'm going to try the Pedagogical 'No' to see what happens". Social life becomes a laboratory.

## Conclusions

You don't need to be a rhetorical genius. You need reliable crutches. These 10 techniques are your crutches. Over time, you will run without them. But for now, use them not to fall.
