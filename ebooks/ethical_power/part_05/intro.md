# Part 5: Mastery

Beyond isolated techniques, there is a state of integration where power flows naturally. This last part seeks to consolidate everything learned into a way of being.

We will cover:

*   Advanced **Frame Control** strategies.
*   How to give **authoritative presentations**.
*   The **Weekly Ritual** to keep the saw sharp.

Mastery is not about having no problems, but having the internal certainty that you will know how to handle them when they appear.
