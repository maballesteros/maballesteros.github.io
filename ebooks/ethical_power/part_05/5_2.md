# 5.2 Authoritative Presentations: The Stage is Yours

> **Learning Objective**: Transfer all mastery skills (voice, body, pauses, frames) to the format of "One against Many" (Public Speaking).

## Story

Mike has to present the annual project. Before, he shrank behind the lectern and read PowerPoints full of text. Today, the stage is his house.

He walks slowly towards the center, without speaking, occupying the space with firm steps **[Power Entry]**. He plants himself in front of the audience and waits. One, two, three seconds of **[Initial Silence]** that force everyone to lift their eyes from their mobiles.

When he has total attention, he projects his deep voice to the back of the room:
"Good morning. Today I am not going to read you data." He pauses and launches the **[Mission Frame]**: "I am going to tell you why we are going to win this year."

The audience smells the authority. They are no longer watching a presentation; they are following a leader.
When someone asks a difficult question, Mike uses the "Present and Defend" technique (Game 12).
"Interesting point. However, the data says X." (Chapter 3.4: Clean No).

When finished, he doesn't run away. He stays receiving the applause.

## Deep Explanation

Speaking in public is the definitive test of power.
Your prey instincts tell you: "Hide, speak fast, flee".
Your predator/leader skills must say: "This is my territory, listen to me".

The 3 Pillars of the Power Presentation:
1.  **Occupy Space**: Don't hide behind the table. Go out into the open. Move with purpose (don't do the St. Vitus dance).
2.  **Tactical Pauses**: Silence is the music of power. Pause *before* what is important and *after* what is important. Let the idea land.
3.  **Real Eye Contact**: Don't look at the "back of the room". Look a person in the eye, tell them a complete sentence. Then look at another. Connect souls, don't scan heads.

## Synthesis of Key Ideas

*   **Status on Stage**: If you apologize for being there ("well, I'll be brief..."), you have lost. You have the right to be there. Enjoy it.
*   **Controlled Enthusiasm**: Passion for the topic, but control of the body. Fire in words, ice in gestures.
*   **Less is More**: Few slides. Few words. Much meaning.

## Practical Examples

### 1. The Start
*   **Error**: "Hello, can you hear me? Well, um, let's see..."
*   **Power**: (Silence). "A year ago, we were bankrupt. Today, we are leaders. I'll tell you how." (Direct hook).

### 2. The Technical Error
*   **Error**: "Oh, sorry, the PowerPoint isn't working, what a disaster..." (Panic).
*   **Power**: "Technology rests. I will continue." (Turn off the screen and keep talking). Demonstrates that you are the message, not the PPT.

### 3. The Hostile Question
*   **Question**: "No one believes that".
*   **Answer**: Pause. Gaze. "You have the right to be skeptical. But the results are audited. Next question." (You don't take the bait, validate and dispatch).

## Signs of Progress

1.  **Anxiety turned into excitement**:
    *   *Do your hands shake but your eyes shine?* Stage fright never completely disappears, but it becomes propelling energy.
2.  **You enjoy the silence**:
    *   *Do you no longer fill gaps with "ummm"?* You feel comfortable being silent in front of 100 people. That is the nirvana of power.
3.  **You record yourself and like it**:
    *   *Do you watch your videos?* You look solid. You would buy from yourself.

## Common Mistakes

*   **Reading the PowerPoint**
    *   *The Death*: If you read, you are superfluous. Send them the PDF by mail.
    *   *Alternative*: Big images, you tell the story.
*   **Moving non-stop**
    *   *The Caged Lion*: Walking side to side. Makes people dizzy.
    *   *Alternative*: Plant your feet. Move only to change topic (spatial anchor).

## Conclusions

Speaking in public is not "acting". It is being yourself, but in amplified version. It is you with volume at 11. If you can hold the gaze of 50 people, holding that of 1 (your boss, your partner) will be a piece of cake.

## Deliberate Practice

*   **Card**: [Game 12: Present and Defend](../games/game_12.md).
*   **Challenge**: Volunteer to present anything this week. Even if it is the birthday toast. Take the mic.
