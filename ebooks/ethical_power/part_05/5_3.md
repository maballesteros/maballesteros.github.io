# 5.3 Weekly Ritual: Maintenance of Power

> **Learning Objective**: Establish a periodic review system to ensure skills don't rust and continue progressing indefinitely.

## Story

Mike has finished the training. He feels transformed, but knows that "Old Mike" (insecure, compliant) is still alive in his brain, waiting for a moment of weakness to return. Entropy always wins if there is no maintenance.

That's why Mike institutes the **Sunday Ritual**.
At 19:00, he sits for 15 minutes with his notebook. First, he **[Audits]** his week: "Where did I give away my power? Where did I defend it?". Then, he chooses his **[Focus]** for the next one: "This week I'm going to focus only on PAUSES". Finally, he injects **[Technical Inspiration]**: watches a video analysis by TPM to sharpen his clinical eye.

It is his "Social Gym". Just as he lifts weights not to lose muscle, he does this not to lose character.

## Deep Explanation

Personal development is not an event ("I did a course"), it is a process ("I am a person who trains").
Social skills are perishable. If you stop practicing the "Clean No", you will go back to giving explanations in two months.
The only way to avoid entropy is the **Ritual**.

Your maintenance system must include:
1.  **Self-awareness (Journaling)**: Writing your interactions helps you process them objectively.
2.  **Uncomfortable Practice (Exposure)**: Actively seeking situations that scare you (negotiating, public speaking) to keep the callus hard.
3.  **Quality Input**: Reading people like Lucio Buffalmano (TPM), Robert Greene, Cialdini. Keeping the brain fed with strategy.

## Synthesis of Key Ideas

*   **Identity Shift**: The final goal is not "doing" power things, it is "being" a person of power. When it becomes unconscious, you have won.
*   **Kaizen**: Continuous improvement. 1% better every week. In a year you are unrecognizable.
*   **Power is Service**: Remember, you accumulate power not to abuse, but to be more useful, protect yours and advance good things. Power without purpose is empty.

## The Maintenance Plan (The Sheet)

Copy this into your recurring agenda:

**Sunday - Status Audit**
1.  **Top Win**: What was my best play this week? (Celebrate it).
2.  **Top Fail**: Where did I shrink? (Analyze the why without guilt).
3.  **Focus Next**: Which chapter of the Ebook will I reread and practice Monday and Tuesday?

## Ebook Conclusions

You have reached the end.
You started learning to look in the eyes (Chapter 1.4) and have finished learning to control the reality frame of an entire room (Chapter 5.2).
The journey from "Dummy" to "Player" is the journey from victimization to responsibility.
You can no longer say "it's that they do to me...". Now you know that you allow or forbid. You frame. You decide.

The world is a tough place, but also fascinating. Play well. Play fair. And win.

A hug of power.
