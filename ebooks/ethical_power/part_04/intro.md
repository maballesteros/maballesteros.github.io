# Part 4: Power Plays

Sometimes, friction is not accidental. There are people who use specific tactics, consciously or unconsciously, to destabilize you. This section is your manual for verbal self-defense.

We will analyze and neutralize:

*   Systematic **interruption**.
*   The **disqualifying joke** (the "I was only joking").
*   Procrastination and lack of commitment.
*   Unsolicited physical contact ("touching without permission").
*   The **Teacher-Pupil** dynamic (when they explain the obvious to you).
*   The **Waiting Game** (the use of waiting as control).

The goal is not to counterattack, but to deactivate the play and return the interaction to a plane of mutual respect.
