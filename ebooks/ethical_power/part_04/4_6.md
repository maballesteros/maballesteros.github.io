# 4.6 “Teacher–pupil”: The Perpetual Student Graduates Today

> **Learning Objective**: Identify when someone places you in the role of "ignorant student" to elevate their own status, and learn to break that frame to relate as equals.

## Story

Mike is explaining how he fixed the server. A colleague, "Know-it-all", interrupts him with an air of sufficiency:
—Let's see, Mike, what you have to understand is that Linux servers run by processes... —and he launches into a basic explanation from freshman year.

Know-it-all is using the **[Teacher-Pupil]** frame: he plays Teacher and relegates Mike to Pupil. If Mike nods and says "thanks", he accepts subordination.

Mike decides to stop the masterclass.
—**[Validation Interruption]**: Yes, I know the process architecture perfectly, Louis. I've been doing this for 10 years.

Louis tries to continue: "Yeah, but it's so you understand the base...".
Mike doesn't let him lower the level.
—**[Re-frame to Goal]**: The base is clear. The specific problem here is driver X. Let's talk about that. What do you think of the driver?

With three sentences, Mike has validated his competence, rejected the basic lesson, and imposed an expert-level topic. Now they are two engineers debating, not a master and an intern.

## Deep Explanation

The **Teacher-Pupil** frame is seductive because it looks like "help". But it is often dominance in disguise.
The "Teacher" explains things you already know, or gives you advice you haven't asked for, to feel wise and superior.
The "Pupil" nods, takes notes, and gives thanks.

The danger is getting trapped in the Pupil role eternally. If they always treat you as an apprentice, they will never give you the promotion, the respect, or the leadership.
To graduate, you have to **demonstrate competence**. You have to say: "I already know that. Let's move to the next level".

## Synthesis of Key Ideas

*   **Teacher-Pupil**: One of the most stable power frames. Breaking it requires proving that you also have knowledge.
*   **Unsolicited advice**: Usually criticism in disguise. "You should dress better" = "You dress badly and I have better taste". Reject them kindly.
*   **Leveling Up**: If he uses technical jargon, you use technical jargon. If he cites a book, you cite another. Prove you play in the same league.

## Practical Examples

### 1. The Brother-in-law who explains life to you
*   **Situation**: "What you have to do with your money is invest in crypto..."
*   **Action**: Expert closing.
*   **Phrase**: *"Thanks, man. I already have my own diversified investment strategy and it's doing well. I'm not looking for advice right now."*
*   **Why it works**: "I have my strategy" = I am a responsible adult, not a lost child.

### 2. The Colleague who explains your job (Mansplaining)
*   **Situation**: Explains something obvious about your field.
*   **Action**: Obviousness meta-comment.
*   **Phrase**: *"Correct. That is the industry standard. What we are debating here is the exception of case B..."*
*   **Why it works**: "It is the standard" implies "everyone knows that, you haven't said anything new". You take away his guru air.

### 3. The Micromanager Boss
*   **Situation**: Tells you step by step how to write an email.
*   **Action**: Request for autonomy.
*   **Phrase**: *"I understand the goal of the mail. Let me draft it my way and I'll pass you the final draft. I prefer to focus on the result than on the microsystem."*

## Signs of Progress

1.  **You interrupt lessons**:
    *   *Do you stop enduring lectures?* When someone starts explaining the alphabet to you, you tell them "I know the letters, let's go to the sentences". You value your time.
2.  **You provide value**:
    *   *Do you speak too?* The conversation becomes bidirectional. You not only receive info, you also give it.
3.  **They ask your opinion**:
    *   *Reverse consulting?* The "Teacher" starts asking you "And what would you do?". You have achieved the status jump.

## Common Mistakes

*   **Playing dumb to not offend**
    *   *It looks like this*: Nodding at obvious explanations so the other feels smart.
    *   *Result*: They label you as "nice but simple".
    *   *Alternative*: "Yes, exactly, as we saw in project X..." (Connect with previous experience).
*   **Fighting ("I already know that, annoying!")**
    *   *It looks like this*: Reactive aggression.
    *   *Result*: You look like a rebellious teenager (which is still a child frame).
    *   *Alternative*: Professional coldness. "I know the data."

## Conclusions

No one gives you the title of "Equal" or "Expert". You have to take it. Stop behaving as if you were in school waiting for permission to speak. You have experience, you have judgment. Put it on the table.

## Deliberate Practice

*   **Card**: [Game 10: Anti-Teacher-Pupil](../games/game_10.md).
*   **Why it helps**: Role-play where one acts as an insufferable know-it-all. Practice cutting phrases: "Understood", "Let's move to action", "I have that point covered".
