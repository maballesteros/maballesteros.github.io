## Author’s Note

This book is not about dominating others.

It’s about understanding what actually happens in everyday interactions — when conversations feel tense, when boundaries blur, when you leave a situation uneasy without knowing why.

For a long time, I avoided anything related to “power.” It felt manipulative, unethical, incompatible with being a decent person. Over time, I realized that avoiding power didn’t make me more ethical — it made me less capable. Less capable of setting boundaries, protecting relationships, or keeping conversations healthy.

Power, understood as influence, exists everywhere: at home, at work, in friendships, in small daily interactions. Ignoring it doesn’t make it disappear. It simply leaves it in untrained hands.

This book proposes a simple idea: **learn to use power consciously and ethically so interactions become clearer, calmer, and fairer — not harsher**.

If you’re looking for tricks to manipulate or intimidate others, this is not your book.
If you want to speak clearly, set boundaries without aggression, and move through social situations without losing yourself, you’re in the right place.
