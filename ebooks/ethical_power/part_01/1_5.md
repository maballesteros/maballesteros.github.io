# 1.5 CPS Structure: Verify, Ask for Response, Close

> **Learning Objective**: Master the "Context - Proposal - Next Step" structure to eliminate ambiguity, avoid infinite threads, and achieve firm commitments.

## Story

Project team WhatsApp. Twelve messages, zero decisions. Mike records a 20-second audio:

—**[Context:]** We need to define interim delivery. **[Proposal:]** (A) Tuesday 18:00; (B) Wednesday 8:30. **[Next step:]** Responses today before 20:00. Martha and Alan, do you confirm availability?

Silence of seven minutes. A smiley face. Mike insists, neutral:

—I rephrase to make sure we have it: Martha, A or B? Alan, A or B?

Minute nine. Martha: “B works for me”. Alan: “A works better for me”.

—Great. **[Closing:]** Wednesday 8:30 wins; I upload agenda and responsible persons.

That afternoon, a colleague reopens the topic with a “maybe it would be better…”. Mike replies:

—If there is a change, let it be with **[argument]** and **[responsible person]**. If not, we maintain closing.

## Deep Explanation

Ambiguity is the enemy of execution and the refuge of passive manipulators. How many times have you left a meeting or group chat without knowing exactly what has been decided? Chaos benefits those who do not want to work or who want to refute decisions *ex post* ("I didn't say that").

Mike uses the **CPS (Context - Proposal - Next Step)** triad to cut through the noise.
1.  **Context**: Define the objective problem. "We need a date", "The kitchen is dirty". No one can argue with a neutral fact.
2.  **Proposal**: Offer closed options (A or B). This reduces the cognitive load on others. It is easier to choose than to create.
3.  **Next Step**: Put a date and name. "Martha, A or B before 20:00?". Without this, the proposal is just a wish.

In addition, Mike exercises **Closing Tenacity**. When they respond with a "smiley face" (a low-effort response that commits to nothing), he doesn't let it pass. He insists: "A or B?". This teaches the group that half-measures don't work with him.
And when someone tries to reopen the topic out of time ("maybe it would be better..."), Mike applies a **reopening tax**: "If you want to change it, bring an argument and a responsible person". That is: complaining has a price. If you are not willing to pay the price (work on the alternative), the closing stands.

## Synthesis of Key Ideas

*   **CPS (Context–Proposal–Next step)**: It is the algorithm of effectiveness. It transforms complaints or doubts into executable action plans.
*   **Operational Closing**: Whoever closes the conversation defines reality. If you say "then we do X", and no one objects, you have led.
*   **Reopening Cost**: Do not allow agreements to be undone on a whim. Demand real "buy-in" to go back (new info or new person responsible).

## Practical Examples

### 1. The Definition Email in Professional Environment
*   **Situation**: A client sends you a vague email: "I'm not quite convinced by the design, give it another thought".
*   **Action**: Do not work blindly. Apply CPS to narrow it down.
*   **Phrase**: *"**[Context]** Understood that the current design does not fit. **[Proposal]** To get it right, we need to know if the fault is color or structure. **[Next step]** Can we have a 10 min call tomorrow at 10:00 to see it?"*
*   **Why it works**: You convert a nebulous complaint into an operational meeting. You take control of the process.

### 2. Weekend Logistics in Family Environment
*   **Situation**: Friday afternoon, no one knows what is happening Saturday. "I don't know, whatever you want", "well, we'll see".
*   **Action**: Cut the loop of indecision.
*   **Phrase**: *"**[Context]** Tomorrow it's going to be sunny and we want to go out. **[Proposal]** Option 1: Beach in the morning. Option 2: Zoo. **[Next step]** Vote now. If there are no votes in 5 min, I decide Zoo."*
*   **Why it works**: The credible threat of "I decide" usually motivates the undecided to vote quickly.

### 3. The Meetup with Friends in Social Environment
*   **Situation**: The typical WhatsApp group where no one specifies a time.
*   **Action**: CPS.
*   **Phrase**: *"Guys, **[Context]** we have to book if we want a spot. **[Proposal]** I've seen the Italian place on the square. **[Next step]** I'm booking for 6 at 21:30. If anyone drops out, let them know before 18:00."*
*   **Why it works**: You go from asking "what are we doing?" (passive role) to informing what is going to be done (leadership role). People usually appreciate someone taking charge of trivial things.

## Signs of Progress

1.  **Binary responses**:
    *   *Do you get people to answer Yes or No?* You have stopped receiving "we'll see" or silences. Your questions are so clear they force a definition.
2.  **Fewer email/chat threads**:
    *   *Have you resolved in 3 messages what used to take 20?* That is power efficiency. You are saving everyone time.
3.  **Closing authority**:
    *   *Do you feel that when you say "ready then", people take it as definitive?* You have built a reputation that your word seals agreements.

## Common Mistakes

*   **The Open Proposal (False Brainstorming)**
    *   *It looks like this*: "Well, what do you feel like doing? I had thought of something, but I don't know..."
    *   *Alternative*: Bring your homework done. Offer a closed menu. "I've seen A or B. Which do you prefer?"
*   **Forgetting the "Next Step" (Deadline)**
    *   *It looks like this*: "Send me your comments." (Without date).
    *   *Result*: No one does it.
    *   *Alternative*: "...before Thursday at 12:00."
*   **Accepting "Administrative Silence" as Agreement**
    *   *It looks like this*: No one answers and you assume it's a yes. Then comes the "oh, I didn't read the message".
    *   *Alternative*: "If you say nothing, I assume it is YES. Correct?". Force explicit validation or armored implicit validation.

## Conclusions

Vague language is a safe haven for those who do not want to commit. CPS language is a spotlight. by using it, you expose yourself (because you propose), but you also force others to expose themselves (to accept or reject). It is a tool of high responsibility. Use it to move things forward, not just to boss around, and you will see how your environment starts to spin "magically" in a more orderly fashion.

## Deliberate Practice

*   **Card**: [Game: 3-Step Sprint Template](../games/game_08.md).
*   **Why it helps**: Practice writing WhatsApp messages using strictly: 1. Facts. 2. Proposal. 3. Closing question. Review your last 10 messages sent: how many were "fluff" and how many were CPS?
