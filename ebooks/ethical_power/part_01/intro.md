# Part 1: Visible Foundations

In this first part, we will build the foundations of ethical power. Before worrying about *what* to say, we must ensure that the platform from which we speak —your voice, your body, your mindset— is solid.

Here you will learn to:

*   Define your **Ethical Purpose**: what you want power for.
*   Drive conversations with authority.
*   Use your **vocal and bodily instrument** to project calm and security.
*   Understand the **CPS Structure** to order ideas.
*   Manage the **right to speak** and high-status active listening.

Without these foundations, any advanced tactic will feel imposed. We start at the base.
