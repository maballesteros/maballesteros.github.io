# 31-Day Book

## Week 1 · Visible Foundations (D1–D7)

**D1. Ethical Purpose of Power**: clarity + respect + cooperation.
Practice: write your “why” in 3 lines.
**D2. Body that Sustains the Voice**: high posture, stable gaze, medium pace. Use pauses (1–2 s). ([thepowermoves.com][1])
**D3. Declaratives that Lead**: “I propose that… / Let's…”, downward inflection. ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D4. Remove “Softeners”**: eliminate “just/maybe/perhaps” and avoid justifying yourself with “because…” by default. ([thepowermoves.com][3])
**D5. CPS Triad**: Context → Proposal → Next step (CPS). ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D6. High-Power Listening**: skip accurately before responding (“If I understand you correctly…”). ([thepowermoves.com][4])
**D7. Protected Turn**: “Let me finish and I'll listen to you after.” Practice defending 20–30 s. ([thepowermoves.com][2])

## Week 2 · Tone, Timing, and Closings (D8–D14)

**D8. Pause and Latency**: pause before speaking; slow down to gain authority. ([thepowermoves.com][5])
**D9. Framing Questions**: “What is the goal here?” (brings the frame to the explicit). ([thepowermoves.com][6])
**D10. Asking for Time Without Losing Status**: “I'll be back in 10 min with 2 options.” ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D11. Operational Closings**: leave concrete agreements (what/who/when). ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D12. Orderly Reset**: “Let's do a 30s reset: list of points and we continue.” ([thepowermoves.com][4])
**D13. Non-verbal Signals**: gaze 60–70%, visible gestures, open shoulders. ([thepowermoves.com][1])
**D14. Spot and Neutralize the “Ear Tap”** (dominant gesture of “repeat”). Brief response + move on. ([thepowermoves.com][7])

## Week 3 · Frames and Boundaries (D15–D21)

**D15. Identifying the Frame**: “I understand this frame as X, do you agree?”. ([thepowermoves.com][6])
**D16. Re-framing in 7 Words**: “It is not X; it is Y. Let's go back to the goal.” ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D17. Naming Subtext Without Aggression**: “I receive this as mockery; was that your intention?”. ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D18. Clean “No” + Alternative**: denies conduct, offers viable option. ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D19. Behavioral Boundary**: “If X continues, I withdraw from the conversation.” (proportionality). ([thepowermoves.com][9])
**D20. Repair**: “To continue, I need A (clarification/apology).” ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D21. Caring for the Relationship**: genuine acknowledgment + maintaining posture. ([thepowermoves.com][10])

## Week 4 · Power Moves and Contexts (D22–D28)

**D22. Power Move Detector**: interruption, ridicule, strategic ignoring, procrastination. Label and score. ([thepowermoves.com][9])
**D23. Anti-Interruption**: “I finish and give you the turn.” (calm voice, CPS at the end). ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D24. Anti-Disqualifying Joke**: “If it serves, we talk about it; if it is a joke, it doesn't add up.” ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D25. Anti-Procrastination**: “Date + person responsible, or there is no agreement.” ([thepowermoves.com][2])
**D26. Touching Without Permission** (social dominance): how to read it and what to do (withdraw gently / mark boundary). ([thepowermoves.com][11])
**D27. “Teacher–Pupil”**: avoid placing yourself (or being placed) as an involuntary student. Equalize frame. ([thepowermoves.com][12])
**D28. Group**: rules for multiple conversations (gazes, rhythm, adding voices). ([thepowermoves.com][4])

## Days 29–31 · Advanced and Transfer

**D29. 10 Frame Control Techniques**: practice “speaking from your frame”, “moving the debate to your turf”, “leveling up”. ([thepowermoves.com][8])
**D30. Presentations with Authority**: preparation, rhythm, closings, difficult questions. ([thepowermoves.com][13])
**D31. Weekly Ritual**: checklist (posture, CPS, frame, boundary, closing) + 10 min family debrief.

> **Key improvement notes vs. previous version**: explicitly included the rule “don't justify with *because*” (D4), management of the “ear tap” gesture (D14), *teacher–pupil* dynamic (D27), and more verifiable body anchors (D2, D13). Also, frame control modules now rely on concrete TPM techniques (D16, D24, D29). ([thepowermoves.com][3])

# Revised Games (Ethical approach + Transfer)

1. **Power Traffic Light 2.0**
   Listen to a phrase and raise green/amber/red; propose a more cooperative CPS version. (Avoid justificatory “because…”). ([thepowermoves.com][3])

2. **Armored Turn + CPS**
   20–30 s without interruption and close with “Next step…”. Rotate roles. ([thepowermoves.com][2])

3. **Lightning Re-frame**
   One person throws a biased frame; another re-frames it in ≤7 words and brings back the goal. ([thepowermoves.com][8])

4. **Joke or Disqualification**
   Classify as a group and choose minimum necessary response (proportionality). ([thepowermoves.com][9])

5. **No + Alternative**
   Cards with impossible requests; answer “No, and I offer…”. Practice tone/pauses. ([thepowermoves.com][8])

6. **Mirror Listening with Points**
   A speaks 30 s; B summarizes; A scores 0–2 for fidelity. Repeat with role reversal. ([thepowermoves.com][4])

7. **Video Detector**
   Short clips: label plays (interruption, ignore, procrastination, “ear tap”) and design countermeasures. ([thepowermoves.com][14])

8. **3-Step Sprint Template**
   Chaotic messages → CPS on whiteboards/post-its, with closing and responsible person. ([thepowermoves.com][2])

9. **Group Landing**
   Simulations of multiple conversation: practice circular gaze and pauses. Heat/status debrief. ([thepowermoves.com][4])

10. **Anti-Teacher–Pupil**
    Role-play: someone “teaches” to raise status; the other equalizes frame with peer questions and proposes co-analysis. ([thepowermoves.com][12])

11. **Touching Isn't Free**
    Simulates closing touches (shoulder/back). Practice respectful responses that mark boundaries. ([thepowermoves.com][11])

12. **Present and Defend**
    Micro-presentations of 60 s + round of difficult questions. Evaluate rhythm, gaze, closing. ([thepowermoves.com][13])

## Ethical Guide (Reminder)

* **Mutual Dignity**: no one “wins” by humiliating.
* **Transparency**: say the goal and the frame.
* **Proportionality**: minimum effective response.
* **Cooperation**: seek real win-win.
* **Responsibility**: repair if you cross the line.

Next step? I can convert this into a **printable PDF** (1 page per day + game cards) or a **mobile mini-site** for your children to consult easily. Which format suits you better?

========================

Let's go for **Week 1** with the new format!
Each day includes: **Story (300–400 words)** → **Explanation** (with key ideas from ThePowerMoves) → **Daily Practices**.

---

# Day 1 — Ethical Purpose: Power = Fair Influence

**Story (≈360 words)**
Sunday dinner is usually noisy. Mark arrives late, throws his backpack, and drops a “bah, I'm skipping cleanup today.” Daniel jokes: “Sure, the prince doesn't scrub.” Laughter is heard, the kind that pricks. Christina frowns; Mike breathes, puts down his glass, and looks at the three of them.

—I want this house to work without anyone stepping on anyone —he says—. Today we are tired, but respect is not negotiable.

Silence. No sermon; just a clear pause.

—Context: the kitchen was left a mess yesterday. Proposal: Mark scrubs, Daniel dries, I clear the table. Next step: in twenty minutes, done. —Mike looks at Mark—. Does that work for you?

Mark hesitates, looks at Daniel, then at his father. —Okay… but the “prince” thing is unnecessary.

—Noted —says Mike, without raising his tone—. And thanks for saying it.

Daniel raises his hands: —Sorry. It was a joke.

—Closing —adds Mike—: today we split it like this; tomorrow we review. The rule: jokes yes, disqualifications no.

They get moving. There is no epic. Just a calm feeling: everyone knows what to do and why. When they finish, Mike returns for a moment:

—One more thing. If something bothers you, tell me like Mark did: clearly and with respect. Here we talk to understand each other, not to beat each other.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **Dynamic Power**: every interaction has a status and influence game; understanding it prevents you from being “walked all over” or you stepping on others. The goal is effectiveness with respect. ([The Power Moves][1])
* **Assertiveness**: expressing rights, boundaries, and requests with clarity and respect (neither passive nor aggressive). In the story, Mike sets the frame (“respect is not negotiable”), proposes a plan, and asks for agreement. ([The Power Moves][2])
* **Operational Closing**: “what–who–when” reduces ambiguity and prevents future friction. ([The Power Moves][3])

**Daily Practices**

* Write your “why” (3 lines) about **ethical power** at home.
* Make a closing with “what–who–when” in a mini-family task.

# Day 2 — Driving the Conversation: Tempo, Tone, Theme

**Story (≈340 words)**
Quick meeting in the afternoon: the class movie Friday needs organizing. Four voices overlap. Someone drifts to the price of popcorn; another person goes into an anecdote from 2019.

—One moment, I'm stopping here for thirty seconds —says Mike, shoulders open, calm voice—. Goal: decide place and time. I propose two options: (A) Louis's house, 19:00; (B) school, 18:30, large classroom. Quick preferences?

The room orders itself. —It's the same to me —someone says.
—Then I note it as “A” —responds Mike—. Continuing: who brings the projector?

—I can —jumps in Martha—, but I need an extension cord.

—Great. I temporarily close projector: Martha + extension cord. —He looks at the table—. Anything outside the objective you want to discuss later? We note it in “parking”.

One tries to reopen the popcorn topic: —But if in 2019…

—We recover it at the end if there is time —Mike smiles—. Next point: basic rules (cleanup, volume, departure time). I propose three; do you add any?

Ten minutes. At the end, Mike finishes: —Agreement: Friday at school 18:30; projector Martha; rules A, B, C; pending popcorn in the “parking”. Thanks.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **Speaking with Power** implies **leading**: setting the goal, controlling tempo (pauses, “I stop here”), maintaining the **theme** and **frame** of the meeting. ([The Power Moves][3])
* **Brief Redirections** (“we recover it at the end”) preserve relationship and focus without validating deviations. ([The Power Moves][3])
* **Parking Lot**: separates the relevant from the accessory, preventing you from being framed in others' agendas. ([The Power Moves][4])

**Daily Practices**

* Use three direction phrases: “I stop 30s”, “goal…”, “we recover it at the end”.
* Close with an agreed summary and assigned responsibilities.

# Day 3 — Voice and Pauses: Impact with Fewer Words

**Story (≈330 words)**
At the institute, George and a classmate argue about whether to present via video or live. They raise the volume, they talk over each other. Mike observes and asks for a turn with his hand.

—I propose a one-minute test to you —he says, slower than usual—. First, each defends their option with **ten** words maximum. Then we decide.

They look at each other, puzzled.
George: —“Video: better editing, less nerves, repeatable; plus, it looks professional.”
Classmate: —“Live: energy, contact with audience, authenticity; questions at the end.”

Mike nods; he doesn't fill the silences. —Good. Now a question: which goal weighs more, precision or connection?

Pause. No one speaks. Then George drops, calmer: —Connection.

—Then **live** with a support **clip** —says Mike—. Closing: distribution of parts and brief rehearsal.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **Rhythm and Pause** are status signals: speaking **slower**, using silence, and **verbal economy** convey self-control and raise perceived quality. ([The Power Moves][5])
* **Paralanguage** (tone, volume, speed) influences reading of **dominance/composure**; a slower and clearer delivery usually raises authority without aggression. ([The Power Moves][5])
* The **Framing Question** (“which goal weighs more…?”) directs the decision to the relevant criterion, not the ego. ([The Power Moves][4])

**Daily Practices**

* Exercise “10 words”: synthesize a stance in 10 words.
* Insert 5 conscious pauses before responding in real conversations.

# Day 4 — Body that Sustains the Voice (Posture, Gaze, Gestures)

**Story (≈360 words)**
In the tutorial, the atmosphere is tense. Two families disagree over a misunderstanding in the WhatsApp group. Mike enters, plants both feet, open shoulders, chin level. He doesn't invade, but doesn't shrink either.

—Thanks for coming. I start with the goal —he says without haste—: understand what happened and agree on how to proceed.

While they speak, Mike maintains **stable gaze** (not fixed, not elusive), **economical gestures**, and visible hands on the table. When one of the parents accelerates and raises the tone, he lowers his own. When the mother hesitates, he nods gently once, without nervous nodding. When they interrupt each other:

—I ask for a turn for each. I listen to you first; then to you —he points with an open palm, not with a finger.

The rhythm drops. Nuances appear. Mike summarizes: —I understand A, B, and C. Proposal: close the past issue with a joint note and, moving forward, simple rule: doubts privately before writing to the group. How does that sound?

They look at each other, less rigid. —Yes, sounds good.

—Closing: today we send the note; if there is noise again, we sit down again.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **Dominance vs. Submission** and **Calm vs. Nervousness** are non-verbal dimensions that impact respect and perceived security: upright posture, leveled head, **smooth** and **deliberate** movements. ([The Power Moves][5])
* **Eyes/Oculesics, Gestures, and Proximity**: sustained eye contact (without fixation), visible hands, own space; all communicate agency + openness (power with warmth). ([The Power Moves][5])
* **Covert Dominant Gestures** (e.g., “ear tap”, pointing, invading) can escalate; your response is to **calibrate**: mark turns with open palm and follow the goal. ([The Power Moves][6])

**Daily Practices**

* “60s Check” before a tense topic: firm feet, open shoulders, visible hands, low breathing.
* Gaze stopwatch: 60–70% eye contact in active listening.

---

# Day 5 — CPS Structure: Verify, Ask for Response, Close

**Story (≈330 words)**
Project team WhatsApp. Twelve messages, zero decisions. Mike records a 20-second audio:

—Context: we need to define interim delivery. Proposal: (A) Tuesday 18:00; (B) Wednesday 8:30. Next step: responses today before 20:00. Martha and Alan, do you confirm availability?

Silence of seven minutes. A smiley face. Mike insists, neutral:

—I rephrase to make sure we have it: Martha, A or B? Alan, A or B?

Minute nine. Martha: “B works for me”. Alan: “A works better for me”.

—Closing —responds Mike—: Wednesday 8:30 wins; I upload agenda and responsible perons.

That afternoon, a colleague reopens the topic with a “maybe it would be better…”. Mike replies:

—If there is a change, let it be with **argument** and **responsible party**. If not, we maintain closing.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **CPS (Context–Proposal–Next step)**: practical influence guide; you ask for concrete **response** and **close**. Whoever closes, **molds meaning** and prevents procrastination. ([The Power Moves][3])
* If they **dodge** you, **ask again** without emotional charge, maintaining collaborative frame. ([The Power Moves][3])
* The closing asks for **measurable commitments** (date + responsible); re-openings only with **new information**. ([The Power Moves][4])

**Daily Practices**

* Apply CPS in a real thread.
* Write a closing with what–who–when and ask for explicit confirmation.

---

# Day 6 — Right to Speak and Micro-aggressions: Boundaries Without Fighting

**Story (≈350 words)**
During George's presentation, a classmate drops in a low voice: “Well, if he ever finishes…”. Laughter. George shrinks a little; Mike, sitting at the back, discreetly raises his hand to ask for the floor and George yields it to him.

—Brief meta-comment —says Mike, neutral tone—: that comment is not very respectful to the one presenting. Let's return to the content.

Without accusing or dramatizing, he names the fault and **re-frames**. The classmate blushes and looks at the floor; the teacher gives thanks and asks to continue. George breathes; resumes:

—I was saying: the alternative hypothesis explains the peak better…

Later, on leaving, the classmate approaches: —It wasn't serious, it was a joke.

—Thanks for saying it —responds Mike—. If you have another one, better make it in support of the speaker.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* **Covert Aggression** or micro-fault forces you to choose: either swallow or escalate. The brief **meta-comment** exposes the game without losing frame or overreacting. ([The Power Moves][7])
* A **one-liner** of respect + return to goal avoids theatricality, protects the relationship, and subtracts reinforcement from the aggressor. ([The Power Moves][8])
* Defend **your turn** and that of others: ask for word calmly, name the behavior, ask to return to content. ([The Power Moves][3])

**Daily Practices**

* Rehearse 2 meta-comments of one phrase (“that doesn't add up; let's return to the point”).
* Role-play: interruption → hand raised + “let me finish this idea”.

---

# Day 7 — Group: Passing the Mic, Uniting Voices, Not Reviving the Dead

**Story (≈370 words)**
At home there is a Friday gathering. Topic: mountain weekend or museum? Soon, someone monopolizes with an eternal story of waterproof boots. The rest are disappearing. Mike sees it coming.

—I stop 20 seconds —he smiles—. Goal: decide plan. I do a quick round: **one phrase** per person, without commenting yet.

He passes the “mic” one by one. When someone tries to revive a zombie issue (“like that time that…”), Mike raises his palm:

—We closed that topic; if needed, we see it at the end. I continue with Laura.

The round ends in two minutes. —I see mountain majority, with a condition: **alternative** in case of rain —he summarizes—. Proposal: Saturday short route + barometer at 21:00 to decide Sunday. Anyone doesn't see it?

Comfortable silence.
—Closing: tomorrow mountain, and if it rains, museum.

The conversation drifts to movies. Someone tries to reopen the war of boots. Mike, light: —Parking. I note “boots” for another day.

**Explanation (TPM key ideas)**

* In groups, **moderating with power** is **passing the mic**, adding voices, and **avoiding hijacking** (monopoly) and **reviving dead topics** (zombies). The brief round and the “parking” maintain focus + inclusion. ([The Power Moves][9])
* The clear group closing + **simple rules** prevents the discussion from rotting in anecdotes. ([The Power Moves][3])

**Daily Practices**

* Do a round of “one phrase per person” in a minor decision.
* Point out a zombie topic and move it to “parking” without arguing.

---

## Drafting notes (for your posts)

* After each **story**, open the explanation with **2–3 TPM ideas** (cited) connected to moments of the story.
* Close with **“Try today”** (1 action of 60 s) and **“Sign of progress”** (what to observe).

If you want, I can convert this into **7 full entries** ready to publish (with titles, subtitles, dialogue examples, and “Try today” cards).
